      <p>Use this service to check if you can get Â£140 off your electricity bill for winter 2021 to 2022 under the Warm Home Discount Scheme. </p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Before you start</h2>

      <p>You'll need an Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) for the home you were living in on 21 August 2022. The EPC provides details of the property which we need to check your eligibility.</p>

      <p>If you are a tenant, this may have been provided by the landlord or letting agency when you moved in. If you are a homeowner, it will probably have been provided by the estate agent when you were arranging your purchase.</p>

      <p>If you cannot find a copy of the EPC for your property, you may be able to find the necessary details using our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/find-energy-certificate">Find an energy certificate service</a>, or by <a href="https://propertychecker.co.uk/">searching Property Checker</a>.</p>

      <p>If you cannot find a hard copy, and neither of these services has an EPC for your property, you will have to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/get-new-energy-certificate">get a new energy certificate</a>.</p>
