      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What you will need when you contact us</h2>

      <p>
        Your property may need an Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) for us
        to confirm your eligibility. This certificate tells us how energy
        efficient your property is. If your property's EPC has expired,
        we will still accept it.
