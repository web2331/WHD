      <p>This is based on what you've told us about the property you lived in on 21 August 2022.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">If you believe you might still be eligible</h2>

      <p>
        Call the helpline on 0800 107 8002 and we will check if you are eligible.

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What you will need when you call</h2>

      <p>
        Your property will need an Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) for us
        to confirm your eligibility. This certificate tells us how energy
        efficient your property is. If your property's EPC has expired,
        we will still accept it.

        <a href="#" target="_blank">Find an energy certificate</a> to check if your property has an EPC.

        <a href="#" target="_blank">Get a new energy certificate</a> if your property does not have an EPC.
