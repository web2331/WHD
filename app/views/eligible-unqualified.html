        Call the helpline on 0800 107 8002  before 28 February 2023 and we will check if you are eligible.

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What you will need when you contact us</h2>

      <p>
        Your property may need a complete Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) for us
        to confirm your eligibility. This certificate tells us how energy
        efficient your property is. If your property's EPC has expired,
        we will still accept it.
